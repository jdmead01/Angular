// let - is used when we want to define the scope, within blocks { }, this includes loops, a variable declared as a let within an if block, or for loop block, will not be defined outside of the if block, or the for loop block.

// const - is similar to let, in that it's scoped within blocks, but we are unable to change its type, or value once set. Note: if an object is const, we can't change the object's structure (such as adding, or replacing keys), but we can change the object's values.

const myobj = {
    a: 1, 
    b: 2
}
myobj.a = 5 // ok
myobj.abc = 3 // Error
myobj = {x:1, y:2, z:3} // Error
